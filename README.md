## Technologies

The application is built using the following technologies:

- Python: Programming language used to build the application
- Flask: Web framework used to create the USSD application
- Sqlite: Relational database used to store user information and transaction details
- Redis: Used for efficient scheduling of tasks
- Africa's Talking API: Used for payment handling and SMS notifications to users

## Features

The application offers the following features:

- Account Creation: Users can create an account by entering their name and phone number.
- Top Up: Users can top up their wallet by entering the amount they wish to add.
- Withdraw: Users can withdraw money from their wallet by entering the amount they wish to withdraw.
- Check Balance: Users can check their wallet balance by selecting the balance option from the menu.
- Request Statement: Users can request for their transaction statement by selecting the statement option from the menu.

## Installation

To install and run the application, follow these steps:

### Clone-The-Application
Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/Gibson-Gichuru/E-wallet
```

### Install-App-Dependencies

The application requires redis to be installed and running.
Redis can be installed by following the instructions
[here](), also you need to have Poetry dependency manager installed  
use the [steps](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install Poetry.  

Once redis and Poetry are installed, navigate to the application root directory and run the command below.  
```bash
 poetry install
```

Create a .env file and update the appropriate as described in the env.txt file  

To install pre-commit and pre-push scripts run.  
```bash

  # make sure the hook script have the appropriate permissions

  sudo chmod +x hooks.py

  # install the hooks

  ./hooks.py -i

  # to uninstall the hooks 
  ./hooks.py -u
```

### Run-App

To run the application simply run

```bash
  poetry run flask run

  # or you can activate the virtual environment then run the application

  poetry shell

  flask run

```

To work with africastalking api you'll need to tunnell the application
so that the callback endpoints can be reached remotely  

The application offers a custom commmand to tunnel the http address it's running on using `ngrock`. To activate tunnelling launch a new terminal session and run

```bash

  # the command should install ngrock
  poerty run flask tunnel

  # or

  poetry shell

  flask tunnel
```

The tunnell command will update the application .env file to include full url routes to all the callbacks used in the application

## Testing

The application was developed using a test-driven approach, and tests are included in the `tests` folder. To run the tests, execute `poetry run flask test` from the command line.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to an AWS EC2 instance using a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. The pipeline automatically tests and deploys the application whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch. The configuration for the pipeline can be found in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.

The application offers a custom script To install the application on a server. 

To deploy the application nginx (other web servers can be used) should be installed. to install the application simply run.

```bash
  sudo chmod +x Setup.py

  ./Setup.py
```

The command installs the application as a systemd service and enabling it to launch on boot. (the assumption is that the application would be installed on a unix based operating system which uses `systemd`)

The script also updates the database schema to feature the latest schema (any sqlbased database server can be used. By default the application uses `sqlite` as the main database )

Also the script builds nginx config file and installs it.

Nginx is used as a reverse proxy in this case, thus if any other webserver is used make 
sure it supports reverse proxying to a socket file. as the application on a production 
environment interfaces with the reverse proxy via a unix socket file

## How It Works
